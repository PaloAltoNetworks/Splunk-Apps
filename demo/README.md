## Information

## Install or Upgrade

Assuming you have [docker](https://www.docker.com) installed...

Use these same commands for installing the demo or upgrading an existing demo.

**Create and go to the demo directory**

Start by creating a directory for the demo files. (You can place the files anywhere, but in this example we'll place them in `/opt/splunk-demo`)

    mkdir /opt/splunk-demo     # this command not needed for upgrades
    cd /opt/splunk-demo

**Install the demo on Ubuntu or Kali Linux**

From inside the demo directory you created, type this command to install or upgrade the Palo Alto Networks Splunk app demo:

    curl -sSL http://bit.ly/splunk-panw-demo | sh

## Splunk Login

    Default login is admin:paloalto

## Start and stop

After installation, the server is running.

**Stop the Splunk server**

    docker stop splunk-demo

**Start the Splunk server**

    docker start splunk-demo

## Uninstall

**Remove the running demo container**

    docker rm -fv splunk-demo

**Remove the base image**

    docker rmi btorresgil/splunk-panw-demo

**Remove the demo files**

    # assuming the files are in /opt/splunk-demo
    rm -rf /opt/splunk-demo

## License

You can run the demo unlicensed or with a license.

**Unlicensed**

500 MB can be indexed per day.  This is usually fine for short demos.

**Licensed**

10 GB indexed per day with a free license from the [Splunk Developer Portal](http://dev.splunk.com/page/developer_license_sign_up). This is useful for longer running servers, or servers that need to receive lots of logs from a live firewall:

To install the license, in the Splunk GUI go to Settings -> Licensing

After the server is licensed, it will make you login to the web gui.  The default credentials are admin/paloalto.
