shortdesc = Synchronize user logins and logouts with a Palo Alto Networks Firewall
description = The User-ID system in a Palo Alto Networks Firewall can track user logins so you can write a security policy based on users and groups instead of IP addresses. Splunk can tell the firewall when users login or logout based on authentication logs received by Splunk. Send user logins to the User-ID firewall which will propagate the users to all other firewalls.
