### Description ###

Palo Alto Networks and Splunk have partnered to deliver an advanced
security reporting and analysis tool. The collaboration delivers
operational reporting as well as simplified and configurable dashboard
views across Palo Alto Networks family of next-generation firewalls.

Palo Alto Networks App for Splunk leverages the data visibility provided
by Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls and endpoint security with
Splunk's extensive investigation and visualization capabilities to deliver
an advanced security reporting and analysis tool. This app enables security
analysts, administrators, and architects to correlate application and user
activities across all network and security infrastructures from a real-time
and historical perspective. Complicated incident analysis that previously
consumed days of manual and error-prone data mining can now be completed in a
fraction of the time, saving not only manpower but also enabling key enterprise
security resources to focus on critical, time-sensitive investigations.
